# hand_detector
This is a piece of code showing how to detect and track hands using Tensorflow. It is a sample code from a human-computer interaction software which enable the user to operate his target object on the screen by using his eyes and hands (video link: https://youtu.be/ObQxj5DTbBw). 

The context of this project is to establish a safer and more efficient communication between unmanned vehicles and their ground station operators by using body gestures.
